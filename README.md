# BT_286A_RJ

This PCB converts the two screw terminals on a BT / Vanderhoff Test Telephone 286A to an RJ11 and RJ45 socket - the idea being you can then use additional adapters like an RJ45 to BT "Master". I have made a vague attempt at impedance and length matching, mostly as an experiment.

Why not just use a standard BT socket I hear you ask? Well, PCB mount BT sockets appear almost impossible to source. I found one supplier but they ignored my emails and phone calls. If you can get hold of them, please get in touch.

The RJ11 and RJ45 connectors were sourced from AliExpress. As a result they don't have part numbers but they're fairly common parts. Hopefully you can identify them from the images - if you're unsure please get in touch.

I had the PCBs manufactured by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/). They were able to correctly interpret the pads on the edge of the board and cut the correct shape. I didn't opt for castellated holes due to the additional expense. As a result only the top half of the pad is plated on the board edge but this isn't an issue.
